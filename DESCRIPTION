Description: Functions 
            to generate a random derivation tree of a context-free grammar 
            of bounded depth, 
            to decode a derivation tree, 
            to choose a random node in a derivation tree, 
            to extract a tree whose root is a specified node, and 
            to insert a subtree into a derivation tree at a specified node.
            These functions are necessary for implementing the initializing and 
            decoding of a random population of programs, 
            as well as for implementing 
            crossover and mutation operators for programs.  
            For executing the examples, the package 'BNF' is needed.
            The basic tree operations of generating, extracting, and 
            inserting of derivation trees as well as the conditions 
            for guaranteeing complete derivation trees have been 
            presented in Geyer-Schulz (1997, ISBN:978-3-7908-0830-X).
            The use of random integer vectors for the generation 
            of derivation trees has been introduced in 
            Ryan, C., Collins, J. J., and  O'Neill, M. (1998)
            <doi:10.1007/BFb0055930>.
